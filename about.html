      This platform helps individuals estimate and reflect on their personal
      carbon footprint based on daily lifestyle choices.
    </p>

    <p>
      By translating everyday actions—like transport, food, and energy use—
      into understandable carbon scores, the project aims to encourage gradual,
      sustainable behaviour change.

      Emissions factors are sourced from publicly available datasets and are
      intended for educational use rather than precise accounting.
